SPC Pro: Interactive Statistics for Scientists

An interactive web application built with Streamlit to demonstrate and analyze key statistical concepts used in scientific process control, method validation, and quality assurance. This app is designed to replace static reports with live, hands-on simulations, helping scientists, engineers, and statisticians build a deeper intuition for the data they work with every day.

Key Features
Interactive Demos: Use sliders and controls to manipulate virtual data and see the impact on statistical models in real-time.
Dynamic Plotting: Leverages Plotly to create beautiful, interactive, and publication-ready graphs.
Educational Content: Each module includes detailed explanations of the statistical concepts, their strategic application, historical context, and the underlying mathematical formulas.
Best-Practice Guidance: Highlights the "Golden Rules" of statistical application, contrasting correct and incorrect approaches to analysis.
Modules Included
This application provides a suite of tools for common analytical and validation tasks:
1. Core Validation Parameters
Purpose: Interactively explore the "big three" pillars of method validation as defined by ICH Q2(R1): Accuracy, Precision, and Specificity.
Learn: See how systematic bias, random error (%CV), and interference affect experimental results.
2. Method Comparison (Quantitative)
Purpose: Analyze the agreement between two quantitative measurement methods.
Plots: Generates interactive Deming Regression and Bland-Altman plots.
Learn: Understand how to identify and quantify constant and proportional bias between methods.
3. Pass/Fail Analysis (Qualitative)
Purpose: Evaluate the performance of qualitative (pass/fail) assays by calculating accurate confidence intervals for binomial proportions.
Learn: See why the simple "Wald" interval is dangerously inaccurate and understand the superiority of the Wilson Score and Clopper-Pearson intervals, especially for small sample sizes.
4. Assay Robustness (DOE / RSM)
Purpose: Go beyond simple validation to full process optimization using Design of Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM).
Learn: Discover how to model linear, interaction, and quadratic effects to map a process landscape, find optimal operating conditions, and define a robust Design Space.
Target Audience
